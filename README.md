As far as I can tell, I met every requirement for the description here: https://bitbucket.org/jayoung_turner/interview-challenge-1

Just as a side note, I went through the effort of parsing strings for links before I realized it was unnecessary. Here's what that looked like before I took it out:

Also, I had to install xcode and the xcode command line tools to get the jquery to work. I don't know if that was a safe assumption (I'm on OSX Snow Leopard I believe).
